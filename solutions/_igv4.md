What we see from the molleculo data:

* chr20:31,310,769-31,312,959 - yes
* chr20:61,721,523-61,728,495 - yes
* chr20:52,632,182-52,664,108 - yes

This shows how using an orthogonal technology can improve the confidence in the call, particularly if there is low read evidence from a classical Illumina approach.
